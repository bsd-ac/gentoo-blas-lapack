# Gentoo BLAS/LAPACK chain loading

**This is highly experimental.**

## Overview

Netlib specifications do not mandate the presence of BLAS/LAPACK/etc symbols to be present
in the same library. In fact, they do not even require the libraries to be named
`libblas.so, libcblas.so` or otherwise

This mechanism strictly follows those recommendations and allows creation of dummy
empty libraries, which chain load the libraries with actual symbols, resulting in a
very simple technique to link any library (or set of libaries) as a provider.

## Advantages

- Very simple eclass to register a provider
- No fiddling around with sources to find exact speficications

## Disadvantages

- Breaks false promises of `dlopen` on these libraries.

## Testings

So far, testing has been done with numpy and scipy, both heavy users of these libraries
and they have been working perfectly.

## Future work

- Can we do a function redirection to the appropriate libraries, without a dlopen ?
  [Flexiblas](https://github.com/mpimd-csc/flexiblas/) does something similar but
  that is overkill for our simple problem.
