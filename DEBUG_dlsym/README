example for showing that dlopen and dlsym work with packaged chainloading mechanism

Steps to test

```
make
make run
eselect library set blas openblas
make run
eselect library set blas mkl
make run
eselect library unset blas
make run
```

At each point, you should have a separate running time, demonstrating that the correct library was opened and loaded.
